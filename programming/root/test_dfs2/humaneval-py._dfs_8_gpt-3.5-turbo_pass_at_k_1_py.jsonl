To fix this, we need to add a check to wrap around the alphabet by subtracting 26 from the resulting value if it exceeds the ASCII value of 'z' or 'Z'.", "The implementation failed the last two test cases.

The issue in the implementation is that it does not handle wrapping around the alphabet correctly. When adding 2 * 2 to the ordinal value of a character, it does not account for the case where the resulting value exceeds the ordinal value of 'z' or 'Z'. To overcome this error, we need to handle the wrapping around the alphabet by using the modulo operator (%) with the length of the alphabet (26 for lowercase, 26 for uppercase) after adding the offset.

The issue lies in the calculation of the encrypted character. The current implementation uses a fixed shift of 2 * 2 for both uppercase and lowercase letters.

To fix this, we need to use the modulo operator to ensure that the resulting ASCII value stays within the range of the corresponding letter case. Specifically, we can modify the line encrypted += chr(ord(char) + 2 * 2) to encrypted += chr((ord(char) - ord('a') + 2 * 2) % 26 + ord('a')) for lowercase letters, and encrypted += chr((ord(char) - ord('A') + 2 * 2) % 26 + ord('A')) for uppercase letters.
