The issue in the implementation is that it only checks for the special cases where the note is 'o', 'o|', or '.|', but it does not handle the case where the note starts with 'o' and ends with '.|'. This results in the incorrect assignment of the current beat value for these notes. To fix this, we need to add a condition to handle notes that start with 'o' and end with '.|'.
