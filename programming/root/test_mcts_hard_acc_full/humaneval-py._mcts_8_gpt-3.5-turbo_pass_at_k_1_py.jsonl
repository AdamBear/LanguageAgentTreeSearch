The issue lies in the logic for counting the number of even and odd palindromes. The implementation checks if a number is a palindrome and then checks if it is even or odd. However, this approach does not account for numbers that are both even and palindromes or both odd and palindromes.

This will ensure that we count the number of even and odd palindromes correctly.", "The implementation failed 2 out of the 6 test cases. The issue lies in the logic for counting even and odd palindromes. The implementation only checks if a number is a palindrome and then counts it as either even or odd based on its divisibility by 2.
