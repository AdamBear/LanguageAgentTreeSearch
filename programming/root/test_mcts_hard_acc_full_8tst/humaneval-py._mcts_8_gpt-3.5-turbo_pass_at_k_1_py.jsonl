The issue in the implementation is that it always returns the first prime number in the Fibonacci sequence, regardless of the value of n. This is because the loop that checks for prime numbers in the Fibonacci sequence is not limited to n iterations.

In this case, the implementation keeps generating Fibonacci numbers until it finds n prime Fibonacci numbers, which can result in a very large number.

The issue lies in the condition `len(stack) == 0` to check if the stack is empty. This condition should be `len(stack) != 0` instead, as we want to return False if the stack is not empty after iterating through all the brackets. To fix this, we need to change the condition to `len(stack) != 0` in the if statement.", "MCTS reflections"], "implementations": ["def correct_bracketing(brackets: str) -> bool:\n    stack = []\n    for bracket in brackets:\n        if bracket == '<':\n            stack.append(bracket)\n        elif bracket == '>':\n            if len(stack) == 0:\n                return False\n            stack.pop()\n    return len(stack) == 0", "def correct_bracketing(brackets: str) -> bool:\n    stack = []\n    for bracket in brackets:\n        if bracket == '<':\n            stack.append(bracket)\n        elif bracket == '>':\n            if len(stack) == 0:\n                return False\n            stack.pop()\n    return len(stack) == 0"], "test_feedback": ["Tested passed:\nassert correct_bracketing('<') == False\nassert correct_bracketing('<>') == True\nassert correct_bracketing('<<><>>') == True\nassert correct_bracketing('><<>') == False\nassert correct_bracketing('<<<<<>>>>>') == True\nassert correct_bracketing('<<><>>><<><>>><') == False\nassert correct_bracketing('<<><>>><<><>>><>') == False\n\nTests failed:\nassert correct_bracketing('<<><>>><<><>>') == True # output: False", "Tested passed:\nassert correct_bracketing('<') == False\nassert correct_bracketing('<>') == True\nassert correct_bracketing('<<><>>') == True\nassert correct_bracketing('><<>') == False\nassert correct_bracketing('<<<<<>>>>>') == True\nassert correct_bracketing('<<><>>><<><>>><') == False\nassert correct_bracketing('<<><>>><<><>>><>') == False\n\nTests failed:\nassert correct_bracketing('<<><>>><<><>>') == True # output: False"], "acc": 0.77}
