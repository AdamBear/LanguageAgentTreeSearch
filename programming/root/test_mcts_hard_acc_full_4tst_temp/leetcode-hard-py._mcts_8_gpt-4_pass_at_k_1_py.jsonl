If the number of spaces on a line do not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.\n# \n# For the last line of text, it should be left justified and no extra space is inserted between words.\n# \n# Note:\n# A word is defined as a character sequence consisting of non-space characters only.\n# \n# Each word's length is guaranteed to be greater than 0 and not exceed maxWidth.\n# \n# The input array `words` contains at least one word.\n# \n# \n# Example 1:\n# Input: words = [\"This\", \"is\", \"an\", \"example\", \"of\", \"text\", \"justification.\"], maxWidth = 16\n# Output:\n# [\n#    \"This    is    an\",\n#    \"example  of text\",\n#    \"justification.  \"\n# ]\n# \n# Example 2:\n# Input: words = [\"What\",\"must\",\"be\",\"acknowledgment\",\"shall\",\"be\"], maxWidth = 16\n# Output:\n# [\n#   \"What   must   be\",\n#   \"acknowledgment  \",\n#   \"shall be        \"\n# ]\n# Explanation: Note that the last line is \"shall be    \" instead of \"shall     be\", because the last line must be left-justified instead of fully-justified.\n# \n# Note that the second line is also left-justified becase it contains only one word.\n# \n# \n# Example 3:\n# Input: words = [\"Science\",\"is\",\"what\",\"we\",\"understand\",\"well\",\"enough\",\"to\",\"explain\",\"to\",\"a\",\"computer.\",\"Art\",\"is\",\"everything\",\"else\",\"we\",\"do\"], maxWidth = 20\n# Output:\n# [\n#   \"Science  is  what we\",\n#   \"understand      well\",\n#   \"enough to explain to\",\n#   \"a  computer.

The issue lies in the recursive calls in the for loop. The function checks if the first i characters of s1 are a scramble of the first i characters of s2 and if the remaining characters of s1 are a scramble of the remaining characters of s2.

However, this approach fails when the characters are scrambled in a way that doesn't align with these checks.

To overcome this error, we need to revise our approach to correctly identify scrambled strings, not just permutations.", "The implementation failed the test case where s2 is a rearrangement of s1 but not a scrambled version of it.

This will ensure that all valid paths are considered.", "The implementation failed 3 out of the 4 test cases. The issue is that the endWord is being added multiple times to the path. This is happening because the endWord is not being marked as visited immediately after it is found. As a result, if there are multiple ways to reach the endWord, it is added to the path each time it is found. To overcome this error, we need to mark the endWord as visited immediately after it is found and before adding it to the queue.

The issue arises from the fact that the function does not correctly handle the case where the endWord is also in the wordList. This causes the endWord to be added multiple times to the result paths, leading to incorrect results. To fix this, we need to ensure that the endWord is not added more than once to the result paths.

The issue lies in the breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm, which stops searching as soon as it finds the first level of sequences that reach the endWord. However, there might be other valid sequences in the same level that also reach the endWord, but they are not explored because the BFS stops prematurely. To fix this issue, the BFS should continue exploring all nodes in the current level even after finding the first sequence that reaches the endWord. Only after exploring all nodes in the current level, the BFS should stop.", "The implementation failed the last test case. The issue lies in the way the function constructs the paths from the endWord to the beginWord. The function builds the paths in reverse order, starting from the endWord. However, when there are multiple shortest paths, the function does not always correctly construct all of them. This is because it uses a set to store the parents of each node, and sets do not preserve the order of elements. As a result, the function may not explore all possible paths when there are multiple parents for a node. To fix this issue, we need to modify the function to correctly handle cases where a node has multiple parents.", "The implementation failed 3 out of the 4 test cases. The issue is that the end word is being added multiple times to the path. This happens because the check for the end word and the addition of the word to the path are done in separate steps.

As a result, the end word can be encountered again in a later iteration and added to the path again.

However, there might be other valid paths that haven't been explored yet. To overcome this error, we should continue the breadth-first search (BFS) until we have explored all paths of the current level.

However, the word is also added to the path in the next few lines of code, regardless of whether it equals the endWord or not. This results in the endWord being added to the path multiple times. To fix this, we need to ensure that the endWord is only added to the path once. We can do this by adding a continue statement after appending the path to the answer when the word equals the endWord. This will skip the rest of the current iteration and prevent the endWord from being added to the path again.", "The implementation failed 3 out of the 4 test cases. The issue is that the endWord is being appended to the path multiple times.

The issue is that the output sequences are not in the expected order. The problem lies in the fact that Python's set data structure does not maintain the order of elements. The children dictionary is a defaultdict of sets, which is used to store the transformation sequences.

The correct way to call this function should be through an instance of the class 'Solution'. For example, we should first create an instance of the class 'Solution' like 'sol = Solution()' and then call the function like 'sol.palindromePairs'.
